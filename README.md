# hello-world
I don't know any coding, but I'm looking to learn (12/30/2018)
I got my bachelor's in History from Bob Jones University back in 2015, but now I want a new career path. I've come here to try to develop some programming skills. Hopefully some info sticks.
I like to read, write, work out, play video games, and I like to eat tacos.
